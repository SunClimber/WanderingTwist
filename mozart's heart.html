		  	Mozart walked into the church, cloak billowing, and a hard look on his face.He picked up his pace when he realized the music had already started, he could hear the muffled sounds of the choir. He had anticipated this moment for quite some time, and being late was not a part of the fantasy that often ran in his head. He was annoyed, and flung open the double doors, stepping clumsily in.The effect of the choir was immediate: he stopped moving and listened.</p> 
	<p>The voices coming from the altar were that of angels, he thought. The way they melted into each other, each weaving its own tone over the other and complimenting one another was truly something to behold. The song was euphoric and Mozart closed his eyes, still standing at the doors, and began swaying and letting out slight hums to the melody. He felt as if he was being lifted towards something, something wonderful and joyous, a place of ecstasy.</p><p>He felt a hand on his arm. It was his father, ushering him towards their seats and smiling at him. He whispered, “Come now, my son, it is wonderful, is it not? Lets be seated.”</p>
	<p>Mozart nodded his head and followed his father, the expression of wonder and awe still upon his face. Never had he heard such beauty captured within voice. He could see each voice in his imagination, each tone, playing their part. it</p>
