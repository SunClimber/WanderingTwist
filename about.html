	<p>At times, where I live, in the Midwest, I can hear a train in the distance. It’s whistle calling out to the night, and it captures me, and pulls me into an elaborate dream. I’m driving the train and it’s much louder here. I turn into the head of a big mechanical snake, weaving through small-towns and big fields and if you see me, speeding by, I am nothing but a silhouette cranking on levers and you can only see the cherry of my cigar puffing out smoke to match the chimney of the train. </p>
<p>I imagine this, from the whistle in the distance, and I think about writing it all down, but wonder how. Which words do I use? In which order to put them? Is there a story there or is it merely the equivalent of a painting in my head? A poem perhaps? Ah yes, how the mighty mechanical snake wanders and twists over the metal tracks and through the bleeding heart of every no name town. There’s something there. What does it mean? It beats me, but I like the image and the feeling it gives me. I think, the idea that I could hop on that train, with some ear plugs and a few bottles of water, and look at the graffiti briefly lit time and time again under changing and moving light is something that appeals to me.</p> 
	<p>Then I remember that it’s all overly romanticized bullshit. The practicality of it all, or not even that but the actual desire to do such a thing sounds incredibly lonely. Forget the danger. What isn’t bullshit, though, is that the train exists in my mind. There’s something about the imagination that’s deeply pleasant and, like a train, can take you anywhere you can think of, and especially away from wherever you currently are. It’s an escape.</p>
	<p>All sorts of art can be an escape, along with, essentially, anything you can consume. Of course, this can be a bad thing, to avoid problems, but sometimes there’s nothing you can do in the moment and, to escape momentarily, can be essential to ones mental health and well being. Here’s an escape that won’t leave you broke and homeless. Here’s an escape that will engage you in new and interesting ideas and imaginations. Most importantly, here’s an escape.</p>
